# Whiskython

* **Official page**: [http://whiskyton.herokuapp.com/](http://whiskyton.meiaduzia.com.br/)

## About

This web based app uses [an open database about whisky](https://www.mathstat.strath.ac.uk/outreach/nessie/nessie_whisky.html) to help you find whiskys you'd probably like. It uses mathematics to run through the tastes classified in that database, and to find the best matches. We were inspired by [this data visualization shared on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1u747v/flavor_profiles_for_86_scotch_whiskies/).

## What really matters

This was our very first project in Python.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:<br>`$ git clone git@github.com:cuducos/whiskyton.git`.
2. Go to the repository folder:<br>`$ cd whiskyton`
3. Install the dependencies:<br>`$ poetry install`.
4. Create and feed the database:<br>`$ poetry run flask --app whiskyton db upgrade`.
5. Run the server:<br>`$ poetry run flask --app whiskyton run`

## Tests

To run tests:

```console
$ cargo test --no-default-features
$ poetry run pytest
```

Some tests use your local [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/firefox/) through [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/). So get the server running before running tests.

## Managing the application

### Charts cache

If you want to get rid of all the cached SVG charts: `$ poetry run flask --app whiskyton charts delete`.

If you want to create all possible charts and cache the SVG files: `$ poetry run flask --app whiskyton charts create` (it is not necessary, the app creates and caches them on the fly; however pre-caching them can optimize page loading time).
